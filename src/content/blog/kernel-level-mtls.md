# Reinventing Non-Human Identities with Kernel TLS: How Riptides is Shaping the Future of Secure, Dynamic Applications

At Riptides, we’re revolutionizing the way non-human identities (NHIs) are managed and secured. In today’s fast-paced digital ecosystem—where dynamic AI agents, microservices, and containers are the norm—traditional identity management is struggling to keep up. Our innovative solution leverages a custom kernel module integrated into the Linux kernel, working in tandem with a user space agent and a control plane acting as the root CA. Together, they propagate standardized SPIFFE IDs and enforce mTLS via [kernel TLS (kTLS)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/tls.html), ensuring every process is uniquely identified and securely connected.

Modern applications—especially AI agents—are inherently dynamic. They scale rapidly, communicate continuously, and often change state in real time. Traditional identity management systems, relying on static credentials and manual certificate deployments, can no longer keep pace with these demands.

**Key challenges include:**

- **Scalability:** Handling a vast number of transient processes requires an identity system that can scale seamlessly.
- **Security:** Manual management of credentials and certificates is prone to human error and can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Automation:** Environments that demand rapid provisioning and deprovisioning of services need an automated solution for identity propagation and lifecycle management.

## The Riptides Approach: A Dual-Layer Architecture

Riptides addresses these challenges with a robust, multi-layered architecture that integrates both kernel-level and user space components. This approach combines the strengths of deep system integration with the flexibility of user space operations, ensuring that security measures are embedded so deeply that they become unavoidable for applications—providing exceptionally high integrity.

### Kernel Module with Kernel TLS: The Core of Secure Identity Propagation

Our kernel module is embedded directly into the Linux kernel, where it performs several critical functions:

1. **SPIFFE ID Assignment:**  
   As soon as a process (e.g., an AI agent or microservice) is spawned, the kernel module intercepts the creation event and assigns it a unique SPIFFE ID. This identifier serves as a standardized, immutable representation of the process’s identity across the system.

2. **Deep Kernel Integration:**  
   By operating at the kernel level, our module directly interacts with the process lifecycle. This deep integration means that every process is automatically provisioned with the necessary credentials as it starts—making the security mechanism unavoidable and ensuring a high level of integrity across all applications.

3. **Kernel TLS for mTLS with Hardware Acceleration:**  
   With [kernel TLS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/tls.html), the heavy lifting of establishing secure, encrypted communications is offloaded to the kernel. Not only does kTLS perform the mutual TLS (mTLS) handshake and certificate validation at a low level, but it also leverages hardware acceleration capabilities. This means that encryption and decryption operations are accelerated using dedicated hardware, reducing latency and minimizing performance overhead. This native support simplifies the application layer while enhancing overall security and performance by ensuring that every communication channel is robustly protected and efficient.

4. **Dynamic Identity Updates:**  
   In rapidly changing environments, security policies and identity attributes can evolve in real time. The kernel module supports dynamic updates, meaning any changes—be they policy revisions or attribute modifications—are instantly propagated to the relevant processes. This minimizes the risk window and maintains a continuously secure environment.

### User Space Agent, Policy Framework & Control Plane: Bridging the Gap to Centralized Authority

Complementing the kernel module is a user space agent component that facilitates interaction with our centralized control plane and our proprietary policy framework:

- **User Space Agent Component:**  
  Operating in user space, this agent communicates directly with the kernel module, ensuring that identity credentials are synchronized across the entire system. It acts as a liaison, providing a conduit for policy updates, logging, and other essential management tasks that require user space visibility.

- **Policy Framework:**  
  Our proprietary policy framework is at the heart of the system. It characterizes processes, assigns identities, and defines the rules that govern which SPIFFE IDs can communicate with one another. All these policies are defined centrally in the control plane and are sourced down to the kernel module through the user space agent. This ensures that the entire system adheres to a consistent and dynamic set of security rules, allowing granular control over inter-process communications.

- **Control Plane (Root CA):**  
  Serving as the central authority, the control plane functions as the root Certificate Authority (CA). It issues and manages digital certificates tied to SPIFFE IDs, overseeing the entire certificate lifecycle. The user space agent continuously interacts with the control plane to handle certificate provisioning, renewals, and revocations, ensuring that the security credentials remain current and valid.

## Deep Dive: Kernel Details and Their Impact on Security and Performance

### Low-Level Integration for Enhanced Security

- **Process Lifecycle Interception:**  
  By embedding itself within the Linux kernel, the module can intercept process creation events in real time. This low-level access enables it to assign SPIFFE IDs immediately, ensuring that no process is left unprovisioned.

- **Efficient Resource Management:**  
  Kernel-level operations benefit from lower latency and reduced overhead. Offloading mTLS operations to kTLS means that the cryptographic computations required for secure communications are handled more efficiently, freeing up user space applications to focus on business logic.

- **Real-Time Policy Enforcement:**  
  The kernel module’s ability to dynamically update identities means that security policies can be enforced in real time. Any changes made at the control plane and within our policy framework are rapidly disseminated across the system, ensuring that every process adheres to the latest security standards without delay.

### Kernel TLS: A Game Changer for mTLS

- **High-Performance Encryption:**  
  [Kernel TLS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/tls.html) performs encryption and decryption at the kernel level, leveraging hardware acceleration to minimize context switches and improve throughput. This is particularly beneficial for high-speed applications and dynamic AI agents that require rapid, secure communications.

- **Seamless mTLS Handshake:**  
  The mutual TLS handshake is fully integrated within the kernel, ensuring that both ends of a communication channel are authenticated without requiring additional code modifications at the application level. This transparency is critical for simplifying development and maintaining consistent security practices.

## The Perfect Fit for Dynamic AI Agents

AI agents represent a new class of applications that are both dynamic and rapidly scaling. Riptides’ integrated approach is ideally suited to address their unique needs:

- **Rapid Provisioning:**  
  Automated SPIFFE ID assignment and certificate management mean that AI agents can be deployed quickly and securely, with minimal manual intervention.

- **Adaptive Security:**  
  The ability to perform dynamic identity updates ensures that AI agents remain securely authenticated, even as their operational parameters change in real time.

- **Optimized Performance:**  
  Offloading mTLS operations to the kernel and leveraging hardware acceleration minimizes performance overhead, providing the speed and efficiency necessary for AI-driven tasks and high-speed data processing.

- **Granular Communication Control:**  
  Our proprietary policy framework ensures that only authorized SPIFFE IDs can interact, providing an additional layer of security tailored for the fast-moving nature of AI agents and other dynamic processes.
